# Dynamic AI Agent Orchestrator – Project Requirement Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Introduction

In today’s fast-paced digital environment, many professionals and organizations face repetitive tasks or complex workflows that could be automated using AI.
The **Dynamic AI Agent Orchestrator** is a web application that empowers users to describe a problem or task they wish to automate (e.g., “automate email responses and actions”).
The system leverages an AI Analysis Agent to interpret the problem and dynamically generate a blueprint of required AI agents.
A Builder Agent then automatically creates and configures these agents as lightweight wrappers around existing AI model APIs (such as the free-tier Gemini API).
Finally, an orchestration layer connects the agents into a seamless workflow, with real-time execution tracking and user modification capabilities.

### 1.2 Objectives

- **Dynamic Problem Analysis:** Enable users to input natural language problem descriptions and automatically generate a corresponding set of AI agents.
- **Automated Agent Generation:** Build agents on the fly using a templated system that wraps existing AI model APIs.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** Seamlessly connect and execute dynamically generated agents to perform complex tasks.
- **User Interaction & Customization:** Provide a graphical interface for visualizing, monitoring, and modifying the workflow in real time.
- **Cost-Efficient Deployment:** Leverage free-tier technologies (e.g., Gemini API, MongoDB Atlas, Vercel hosting) to minimize costs while ensuring scalability and performance.

## 2. Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core System & Analysis

1. **User Input Interface:**

   - Develop a backend API endpoint to receive problem statements.
   - Validate and sanitize the input.

2. **Analysis Agent Development:**

   - Integrate an AI model (e.g., Gemini API) to parse the user’s problem.
   - Generate a dynamic blueprint outlining the required AI agents (e.g., Email Classifier, Response Generator).

3. **Specification Generation:**

   - Structure the blueprint into a clear specification format (e.g., JSON) that details each agent’s role and configuration.

4. **Builder Agent Implementation:**
   - Create templated modules that, based on the specification, instantiate individual agent wrappers.
   - Ensure these wrappers can make API calls to the AI model (Gemini) as needed.

### Phase 2: Workflow Orchestration & Execution

5. **Orchestration Layer:**

   - Develop an orchestration engine that connects the agents into a sequential or parallel workflow.
   - Use asynchronous processing to handle long-running tasks.

6. **Real-Time Execution Tracking:**

   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for live updates.
   - Allow users to see execution logs and status updates as the workflow runs.

7. **User Interaction:**
   - Build endpoints and interfaces for modifying agent settings during or before execution.
   - Provide endpoints for pausing, resuming, or re-running workflows.

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Optimization

8. **Advanced Agent Customization:**

   - Enable users to modify agent parameters (e.g., prompts, API settings) via a visual workflow editor.
   - Implement versioning for workflows, allowing rollback to previous configurations.

9. **Performance Optimization:**

   - Optimize backend API calls and asynchronous task handling.
   - Introduce caching, lazy loading, and efficient error handling mechanisms.

10. **Security Enhancements:**
    - Implement JWT authentication and rate limiting.
    - Ensure API keys and sensitive data are securely managed and not exposed to the client.

### Phase 4: Additional Integrations & Future Expansion

11. **External API Integrations:**

    - Allow integration with external systems (e.g., email, calendars) through dedicated agent wrappers.
    - Support multiple AI model APIs if needed.

12. **AI Workflow Marketplace (Future Feature):**
    - Enable users to share and import pre-configured workflows from a community library.
